LEARN MORE
Welcome to FeelCare Home Care Services!<br> <br>

 

At FeelCare, we understand that sometimes, our own families and friends may not be able to provide the care we need when we are frail or unwell. That’s why our trained carers are here for you whenever the need arises. As a family-run home care provider based in London and Hertfordshire, we are dedicated to providing compassionate support, from four hours to full-time live-in care.
<br> <br>
 

Whether you require respite care, assistance at home to live independently, or round-the-clock care, we are here to create a personalised care plan that suits your needs and budget. Our team of expertly trained FeelCare carers is supported by a dedicated care team of in-house experts, ensuring that you receive the care you need and the support you deserve, all while staying informed and in control of your care journey.
<br> <br>
 

At FeelCare, we go beyond just offering essential services. Before starting care, we take the time to get to know you or your loved one as a person, not just a patient. We learn about your favorite foods, music, hobbies, and passions – the things that bring joy and purpose to each day, alongside addressing your care needs.
<br> <br>
 

Our comprehensive range of services includes companionship, personal care and hygiene assistance, medication reminders, support for staying active, grocery shopping, light housekeeping, meal preparation and nutrition, social activities, transportation and errands, engagement in hobbies and passions, cognitive activities, and meaningful activities to enhance the overall well-being.
<br> <br>
 

To ensure FeelCare is the right fit for you and your family, we offer a free initial care assessment. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions you may have, and we’ll be delighted to assist you.
<br> <br>
 

At FeelCare Home Care Services, we’re committed to providing compassionate care and creating a supportive environment that promotes independence, happiness, and well-being. Let us be your trusted partner in caring for your loved ones. Give us a call today to discover how we can make a positive difference in your life.
